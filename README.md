Game pitch - Embark on a thrilling puzzle adventure through the grand Pavilions of UVA’s historic Lawn, where players must conquer mini UVA-themed quests to execute a daring escape (graduation)!

How to play - What do we need to know in order to play the game? Controls? Setup? Anything and everything you think we need. 
Controls: The game uses WASD or arrow keys to move the player, spacebar to interact and to start the game, and escape key to see GPA. To begin the game, enter the main menu and press 'Start College.' The player will spawn on UVA's Lawn, where they can move around to explore the world. A hovering arrow will indicate the direction a player needs to follow to get to a minigame they must complete. They must complete one minigame to move onto the next.


Amount/type of content available - Explain how many levels, what major features are available, etc, basically so we don’t miss anything you created.
There are two playable levels, and the second is unlocked once the first is completed. The next level is pointed to by an arrow near the player. There are individualized NPCs for each year each with their own dialogue. The end of the game is marked by an NPC standing by the Rotunda, which will only show up once you beat both the game. Pressing 'esc' on the lawn will show the player's performance (gpa) across the years, which are calculated by performance in the minigames. The UVA Lawn is explorable from the Rotunda to South Lawn, and themed music is assigned to each scene of the game.


Lessons learned - Firstly, we learned how to become familiar with Unity's environment and how to work with its tools and workflow, which was a platform none of us had worked with before. We learned how to manipulate game mechanics with C# scripting language, which helped with adding customizing to our game. As a group, we learned a lot about the iterative design process where we create prototypes, playtest, give each other feedback, then refine and adjust our game. Especially for UI/UX aspects, getting feedback on the appearances and its impact on the game aesthetic and mechanics was a process that required the perspectives of all group members. As a team, we learned that consistent communication and feedback is essential in game design to fix conflicts and bugs within the game. We had to learn patience and respectful criticism when adapting/readjusting ideas or pivoting in certain directions of our project.
